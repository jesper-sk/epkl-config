===========================================

The EPKL System layout
---------------------------------
- The System layout is a passthrough VirtualKey layout.
- It allows all keys to simply use their underlying Windows system layout mappings.
- It still allows EPKL bells-and-whistles like [Extend][BB_Ext] and sticky mods.
- This should be quite unintrusive, but of course you won't get the eD symbol layers and dead keys.
- You could still add mappings to single keys as desired, for instance locale letters.
